The scene format in Katana is 90% compatible with the dialogue format in CommonCore. I've actually demoed the same one running on both frameworks before. However this may change as CommonCore evolves and Katana does not.

CONDITIONALS

the "conditional" is an array containing "conditionNodes"
each "conditionNode" contains a value for next and an array containing actual conditions that must be met

[
  { //condition node
    "next": "badScene",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "flag": "gotThing"
      },
      {
        "item": "idcard",
        "consume": false
      },
      {
        "variable": "encCounter",
        "greater": 5
      },
      {
        "quest": "d5DestroyTower",
        "started": false
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "next": "goodScene",
    "conditions": []
  }
]

conditionNodes are evaluated from last index to first index, and the first one that resolves true is used (implicit OR)
all conditions form an implicit AND within a node

AVAILABLE CONDITIONS:

flag: <flag>
noflag: <flag>
(checks if a flag is set or unset, no additional options)

item: <item>
	consume: *boolean*
(checks if the player has an item, uses it if specified [consume supported on Katana only])

variable: <variable>
	greater: *number*
	less: *number*
	equal: *number*
	greaterEqual: *number*
	lessEqual: *number*
(checks if a variable meets one of the tests, ONLY ONE AT A TIME IS SUPPORTED)

affinity: <character> [Katana only]
	(all supported by variable)
(checks if affinity meets one of the tests, similar to variable)

actorvalue: <path> [CommonCore only]
	(all supported by variable)
(checks if the actorvalue meets one of the tests, similar to variable, paths are exact variable names)

quest: <quest>
	(all supported by variable)
	started: *boolean* (quest > 0)
	finished: *boolean* (quest < 0)
(checks if quest meets one of the test, similar to variable but supports shorthands)

av: <actorvalue>
	(all supported by variable)

eval: *javascript*
(simply eval() the given code, naturally Katana only)

MICROSCRIPTS

each "microscript" is an array of directives

[
  {
    "flag": "d5Triggered",
    "set": true
  },
  {
    "quest": "d5Quest",
    "set": 1
  }
]

each directive has a target and an action
one action per directive please

AVAILABLE TARGETS
	(supported actions)

flag
	set, toggle
	
item
	give, take
	
variable
	set, add
	
affinity
	set, add

quest
	set, add, start, finish

av
	set, add

eval (Katana only)
	special directive, executes javascript passed as parameter

exec (CommonCore only)
	special directive, looks up and executes a script through ASE engine
	
AVAILABLE ACTIONS

set: sets target to specified value
toggle: flag only, inverts existing value
add: adds specified value to target
give: for inventory: value=quantity, target=item
take: for inventory: value=quantity, target=item (value > 1 is undefined)
start: for quests, sets target to value if and only if quest is not started
finish: for quests, sets target to value if and only if quest is started

non-numeric arguments are technically supported but not recommended
	add is not defined and entirely at the mercy of javascript's type system
	start and finish just simply won't work
	this applies only to katana, not commoncore

MICROSCRIPT DELAY EXTENSIONS (CommonCore Only)

a microscript node can be scheduled for later execution:

[
  {
    "flag": "d5Triggered",
    "set": true,
	"delay": 60,
	"delayType": "world",
	"delayAbsolute": false
  }
]

delay
	delay in seconds

delayType [optional] [default = game]
	real, game, world
	
delayAbsolute [optional] [default = false]

There are three ways to reckon time, and the exact meaning of delayAbsolute changes based on them:
	REAL time: Time in the real world (technically system time). Never stops even if the game is closed. Absolute time is interpreted as seconds since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT). Limited precision.
	GAME time: Time passing inside the game, affected by pause and Unity timescale, but not RPG timescale. Absolute time is interpreted as seconds in game since the game state was created.
	WORLD time: Time passing inside the world, ie affected by RPG timescale. Absolute time is interpreted as seconds in game since the game state was created.
	
Deferred events whose deadlines have passed will be executed as soon as possible. They do not expire.
